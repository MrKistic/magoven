MagOven
=======

MagOven is an open source replacement server for the Baker Framework Newsstand application <http://bakerframework.com>. It offers extended
functionality over the default Baker server options, including content uploading, hosting and APNS messaging functionality.

Version 1.0 was hacked together using Symfony 1.4 some years ago. Sorry about that. Version 2 was in the works but has not
appeared as yet; it was to be built using something at least resembling a modern framework.

Initial development kindly supported by Penguin Books Australia <http://www.penguin.com.au/>
